# Scribblefont

### ATTENTION: This project has become obsolete. Please use [MyScriptFont](http://www.myscriptfont.com/) instead

How cool would it be to have a font of your own handwriting? With Scribblefont you can! Simply write down the alphabet on a piece of paper, scan or photograph it, and upload it to our webapp. The webinterface will allow you to adjust some font metrics (such as [baseline](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseline_%28typography%29) and [kerning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerning)) and Scribblefont will then generate a TrueType font file. Place this file in your "Fonts" folder and you can use your own handwriting as a digital typeface!
